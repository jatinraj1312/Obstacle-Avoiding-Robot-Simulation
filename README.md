# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Simulation
This Arduino-based project simulates a basic autonomous robot in Tinkercad using an ultrasonic sensor and two servo motors. It detects nearby obstacles and changes direction to avoid collisions. The simulation models real-world robotics behaviorâ€”great for beginners exploring sensors, servo control, and robotics logic.
